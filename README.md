## üì± Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the app** - Open Map Mayhem on your mobile device
2. **Select a learning mode** - Choose between Practice, Challenge, or Custom modes
3. **Interact with the map** - Use intuitive touch gestures to navigate and select countries
4. **Track your progress** - Review your learning statistics and improvement over time

### Basic Gameplay

1. The app presents you with a country name to locate
2. The world map appears, allowing you to navigate and find the requested country
3. Tap on the country you believe matches the prompt
4. Receive immediate feedback on your selection
5. The app uses spaced repetition to schedule future appearances of each country based on your performance

### Touch Controls

- **Tap** - Select a country
- **Pinch** - Zoom in/out of the map
- **Drag** - Pan across the map
- **Double-tap** - Quick zoom to a specific area

## üéÆ Game Concept and Mechanics

### Gameplay Flow

Map Mayhem presents an interactive world map and challenges you to locate specific countries. The game dynamically adjusts to your performance:

1. A country name appears as your target
2. The map initially displays a zoomed-out view
3. As you narrow down your search, the map repositions and zooms in on the target region
4. Correct answers provide visual feedback with country highlighting and labeling
5. Incorrect guesses show the correct location to reinforce learning
6. The spaced repetition algorithm schedules countries to reappear based on your performance:
   - Countries you struggle with appear more frequently
   - Well-known countries appear less often to optimize learning time

### Advanced Features

- **Map Rotations** - Optional 90¬∞ rotations or upside-down views to enhance spatial awareness
- **Incremental Difficulty** - Dynamic zoom levels and panning adjust as you improve
- **Custom Region Focus** - Create playlists to focus on specific geographic areas
- **Challenge Modes** - Time-based challenges and competitive options for advanced users

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Framework

Map Mayhem is built with **Flutter** using the **Dart** programming language, providing:

- Cross-platform compatibility for Android and iOS
- High-performance animations for smooth map transitions
- Responsive widget system for intuitive mobile interfaces

### Mapping and Graphics

- Vector-based map rendering using Flutter packages (flutter_svg, google_maps_flutter)
- High-resolution map assets optimized for various mobile screen sizes
- Touch-optimized interactive map with zoom, pan, and rotation gestures

### Spaced Repetition Engine

The core learning algorithm uses a modified FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) implementation:

- Dynamically adjusts review intervals based on performance
- Prioritizes difficult countries while spacing out well-known ones
- Configurable parameters for personalized learning pace

### Data Storage

- Local storage using Flutter plugins (shared_preferences, SQLite)
- Optional cloud synchronization for cross-device progress (Firebase)
- Efficient caching of map assets for offline usage
